The `RTR2` extension provides multiple components that can be assembled
for building a customized rendering pipeline. The RTR's goal is to provide
a good balance between performance and flexibility.

See :ref:`rtr2` for an overview of the framework.

See :ref:`SceneHub<scenehub>` for a global picture of the
:ref:`SceneGraph<scenegraph_overview>`, the :ref:`sceneassembly` and the :ref:`rtr2`.

.. note::

  Various RTR samples are located in the ``/Samples/RTR2`` and can be run with the ``sceheHub`` app, for example ``sceneHub /Samples/RTR2/MovingHierarchy.kl`` 
  (use the `` --unguarded`` flag for optimal performance but unguarded KL compilation).
