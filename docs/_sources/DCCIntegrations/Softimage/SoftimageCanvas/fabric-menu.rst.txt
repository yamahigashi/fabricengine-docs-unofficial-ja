Fabric Menu
===================

In the main menu bar you will find the "Fabric" menu. It contains a set of tools to create graphs, import or export graphs, access the Fabric online help and log information about the current Fabric usage.

  - **Create Graph**

    Creates one or more Canvas operators.

    a.) If you have one or more objects selected then a Canvas operator is created for each selected object.

    b.) If no objects are selected then a picking session is started: use the left mouse button to pick the objects and the right mouse button to end the picking session. Note that you can pick an object several times if you want it to have several Canvas operators.

  - **Create Null with Graph**

    Creates a null with a Canvas operator and displays its property page.

  - **Create Polymesh with Graph**

    Creates an empty polygon mesh with a Canvas operator and displays its property page.

  - **Load Graph**

    Loads a graph into the Canvas operator of the currently selected object.

    This is the same as using "Import Graph" in the operator's property page.

  - **Save Graph**

    Saves the graph of the currently selected object to disk.

    This is the same as using "Export Graph" in the operator's property page.

  - **Inspect Canvas Op**

    Opens the property page for the currently selected object's Canvas operator, if any.

    This is the same as invoking the custom command "FabricCanvasInspectOp".
