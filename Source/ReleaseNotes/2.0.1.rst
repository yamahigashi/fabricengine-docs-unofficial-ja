Fabric Engine 2.0.1 is a bugfix release; please refer to the :ref:`RELNOTES-2.0.0`. for more additional information about the 2.0.0 release (for example, other known limitations).

Supported Operating Systems, Integrations and GPUs
--------------------------------------------------

- Fabric 2 is supported on Windows and Linux. OS X builds are provided but are not officially supported; official support on OS X will arrive in a subsequent release.
- Fabric for Maya integration is supported for Autodesk Maya 2014, 2015 and 2016 and their corresponding service packs and extensions on Windows and Linux. OS X support will follow in a subsequent release. There is a known issue where certain sample scenes fail when Maya 2016 is in Parallel Evaluation mode. This problem has been resolved in Maya 2016 SP4.

.. changes-2.0.1:

Changes
-------

.. note:: Please note that the way KL2DFG works with -inheritance and -polymorphism has changed. Now the polymorphism flag is called **polyThis** and we introduced a new flag **polyParams** for methods with the same notation within an extension, with respect to parameter types.

.. note:: There is also a change in the way  node and preset names are handled. You can now change the node name of a preset, but it won’t be reflected in the node header, which will still show the preset name. Entering the preset will show the Path (which reflects the name of the node) and the Preset Name. When a node has been inlined (Split from preset), any references to the preset name are lost and it will only show the Path.

Fabric Engine 2.0.1 includes additional samples for the Standalone:

- align_to_surface_torus_golden_hair
- constrain_on_surface_torus_wave
- dna_helix
- inlinedrawing_executeports
- morph_cube_to_sphere
- position_set_frog
- raycast_accumulate
- raycast_simple
- relax_on_surface_fade
- relax_on_surface_torus
- voxelize_bullet
- voxelize_frog_wobble
- voxelize_torus


.. _knownissues-2.0.1:

Known Issues, Limitations and Workarounds
-----------------------------------------

- **Limitation**: Saving Presets won’t include the attached comment (FE-4900)

    Workaround: Use the node tooltip property instead 
    
- **Limitation**: In Fabric for Maya and Fabric for Softimage, when creating a new variable via "Right-Click -> New Variable" or by simply copy/pasting an existing variable node, the list of variables in the node explorer will not be refreshed. (FE-5695	)

    Workaround: The variables will appear in the explorer if one closes Canvas and re-opens it. 

- **Limitation**: Graph editor does not update after undoing a name change  (FE-5744)

    Workaround: Entering and exiting the node will force a refresh of the name.

- **Limitation**: The surface scuplting example scene for Maya (manipulation_surfacesculpting.ma) does not work correctly with Maya 2016.


.. _fixes-2.0.1:

List of Issues Addressed
------------------------


**General**

FE-5658	Added the environment variable FABRIC_NO_EXPIRY_DIALOG to set-up the license warning as a log instead of a popup.

FE-5431 	OpenGL warning when opening canvas on OS X has been fixed.

FE-5426 	Removed dumpstack() trace in InlineTransformBase method of InlineTransform.kl 

FE-5487 	Split windows prompt.bat in two files: environment.bat which sets the environment variables and prompt.bat which calls environment.bat and then opens a command line. 

FE-5643 	Corrected an issue where the Splice API always consumed an interactive license.

FE-5650	Allow emptying the required extension field from a preset/graph.

FE-5644	Fix default name when executing “create preset” and the node is already a preset.

FE-5674	Avoid ‘Graph Saved’ messages when autosaving.

FE-5620 	Exporting a preset no longer breaks the undo stack.


**Core**

FE-5632	Implemented a method to load DFG presets and Extensions programmatically instead using environment variables with FabricCore::Client::registerExtensions(pathname).

FE-5637 	License limit error message was printed for all Fabric 50 users.  Now the message only appears when there are 3 or fewer licenses available.

FE-5573 	Cache nodes inside compounds now have the same performance as exploding the compound.

FE-5627 	More than one _ and a number is now allowed in the script name of a node.

FE-5601 	Exploding multiple copies of a compound no longer results in duplicated connections and crashing.

FE-5526 	OSX GCC Visibility settings are now set properly.

FE-5696	Allow resolution of old port names when polymorphic ports generated by KL2DFG have been renamed.

FE-5462	Execute ports now behave as expected.

FE-5400	Creating an out port of type Execute no longer causes Canvas to crash.

FE-5486	ANSI support for Fabric Cache dirs has been added, allowing accents and umlaute characters.

FE-5635	FABRIC_LOG_LEVEL has been improved.

FE-5618	Ensure that unresolved type errors only block execution of graphs when they are actually connected to the output of the graph.

FE-5108	Copying external arrays into variable arrays is now possible (Vec3<> to a Vec3[] port).

FE-5516	Presets were showing up in 'Variables' section of the node explorer even though they didn't have any variables.

FE-5525	.clone() was not working properly with dictionaries of arrays.


**UX**

FE-5162 	The symbols and icons in the node header menu (when connecting ports) have been improved.

FE-4577 	Renaming nodes has been improved to avoid ambiguity with titles and names.

FE-5504 	accents (e.g. 'é') and umlaute (e.g. 'ä')  are now supported in filenames.

FE-5506	Save file dialog in Linux now adds .canvas extension.


**UI**

FE-5167	Canvas Path (the name at the top of the canvas) text is more legible.

FE-5458	Color picker works as expected on OS X.

FE-5374	Some drawing glitches with connections and collapsed nodes have been resolved.


**KL2DFG**

FE-5499 	-inheritance and -polymorphism flags were not working in certain situations. Now the polymorphism option is called polyThis and we introduced a polyParams parameter for methods with the same notation within an extension, with respect to parameter types.  For more information, see :ref:`canvas-programmer-guide-kl2dfg`

FE-5450	^and % operator overloading has been corrected.


**KL2EDK**

FE-5051	KL Dict iteration exposed in EDK.


**PRESETS**

FE-5032 	Function presets are saved with carriage returns instead of \\n.

FE-5101	Object.isNull was actually isNotNull. This was Not Correct :-)

FE-5454 	notifyExecPresetFileRefCountDidChange is now called recursively.

FE-5610 	Splitting a preset, then changing the code of a nested inlined node was persisting the change within the session to other instances of the original preset.

FE-5679	InlineDrawing drawing handles now have execute ports.

FE-5581 	RelaxOnSurface preset added. It relaxes an array of Vec3 on the surface of a polygon mesh.

FE-5582 	Voxelize preset added. It converts the volume of a polygon mesh into an array of Xfo in new preset 'Voxelize' in 'Compounds/Instanciate/'.

FE-5585	PushOnSurface preset added. It moves positions to the closest location of a polygon mesh.

FE-5584	AlignToSurface preset added. It aligns the orientation of an array of XFOs to the surface normals of a polygon mesh.

FE-5583	GeneratePositionSet preset added. It generates a set of positions on a surface. This is not to be confused with the existing "Scatter" preset. Instead, "GeneratePositionSet" creates non-random and fairly evenly distributed positions.


**EXTENSIONS**

FE-4925	Math Extension: The '+' operator of Box2/Box3 has been corrected.

FE-5558	Math Extension: Matrix node elements no longer have hardcoded port names.


**Fabric for Maya**

FE-5659	Canvas nodes can now be copy pasted inside Maya.

FE-5603	On Linux (only) libFabricSplice and libFabricMaya are now dynamically linked.

FE-5298	Replaced MString and std::string with FTL::StrRef to improve the performance.

FE-4799	Removed opaque in DCC option.

FE-5301	Timers now exclude recursive handle pulls.


**Fabric for Softimage**

FE-5631 	"FabricCanvasGetContextID" and "FabricCanvasGetBindingID" commands have been added.

FE- 5670	“FabricCanvasInspectOp” command added, with a new menu entry 'Inspect Canvas Op'.

FE-5642	Canvas / Splice Ops now work inside reference models.

FE-5522	EvalContext in BaseInterface class implemented so that the node “Current EvalContext” outputs the correct data.

FE-5534	Changing String port from Internal to XSI Parameter is now possible.
