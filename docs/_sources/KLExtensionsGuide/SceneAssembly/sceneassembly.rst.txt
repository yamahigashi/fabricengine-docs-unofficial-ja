Scene Assembly
==============

The scene assembly is the procedural scene processing portion of the :ref:`SceneHub<scenehub>`.
It consist of a processing graph containing nodes that query, filter, merge or augment
scene element groups. It includes, too, a set of interfaces for abstracting the scene
implementation while allowing for efficient, asynchronous processing, which is implemented
by the :ref:`SceneGraph<scenegraph_overview>`.

.. warning::

  The SceneAssembly extension is in early development stages and will grow in the next releases.
  In particular, there is currently no support for visual creation
  of processing graphs (DFG) however this is planned for future releases.

The following objects and interfaces constitute the main building blocs of the scene assembly framework:

- The :kl-ref:`SceneWrapper` interface is the main interface for abstracting a source scene
  (such as the :ref:`SceneGraph<scenegraph_overview>`). It allows to create generic 
  evaluation contexts (:kl-ref:`SWContext`), queries and reference arrays.

- The :kl-ref:`SWElementReference` refers to a scene element or sub-property.
  By implementing support for these, the scene provides an abstraction of its elements
  that allows for efficient and generic processing.

  :kl-ref:`SWElementReference`'s methods allow for generic functionality such as:

  - Get its type and value

  - Request :kl-ref:`SWElementReference` for sub-properties (eg: `globalTransform`)

  - Get its full name (mostly for debug purpose)

  - Ability to update or generate its value for a specific scene context (:kl-ref:`SWContext`, eg: for a specific 
    frame) and provides a value version which allows clients to asynchronously detect changes.

  - Attach an adaptor for a specific target (eg: OpenGL/RealTimeRenderer adaptor).
    The adaptor will be attached to scene's source element (share by all SWElementReference 
    that refer to the same scene element)

  .. note::

    The :kl-ref:`SWElementReference` is a simple struct that is an accessor for a specifc
    indexed :kl-ref:`SWElementReferenceArray` item. It basically wraps a [elementsArray, index]
    pair, which simplifies its usage while maintaining regrouped element allocation for
    better performance and memory usage.

- The :kl-ref:`BaseDynamicGroup` is the base class for scene assembly processing nodes.
  It allows to collect an indexed set of scene items, provides information for updating
  ouput groups asynchronously and maintains a link to items' source groups
  (access to their :kl-ref:`SWElementReference`). The :kl-ref:`BaseDynamicGroup`
  is optimized for efficiency and low memory usage.

The connected scene assembly nodes form a procedural scene processing graph.
All nodes implement an `update` method which takes a :kl-ref:`SWContext`.
The nodes recursively call `update` on their input group before
updating their state and data. Nodes themselve have a version
(:kl-ref:`Versioned` interface), which allows connected groups
to detect if their data changed.

The provided nodes and data include the following:

- :kl-ref:`SWDynamicGroup`: an initial group providing a set of
  source :kl-ref:`SWElementReference`. The :kl-ref:`SceneWrapper.createInstanceQuery` method
  allows to create :kl-ref:`SWDynamicGroup` containing the result of a scene query.

- The :kl-ref:`BaseDynamicGroupFilter` base object provides services for creating
  a filtered subset of an input :kl-ref:`BaseDynamicGroup`.

- The :kl-ref:`DynamicGroupVolumeFilter` filter node will select scene elements
  based on their bounding box (`globalBBox` property) and a specified volume query.
  For a better performance, it uses a :kl-ref:`DynamicGroupOctree` which can incrementally
  updates an :kl-ref:`Octree` of the input scene elements. The :kl-ref:`RTRCullFromVolumeTask`
  is a specialization of the :kl-ref:`DynamicGroupVolumeFilter` for culling scene elements
  based on camera's volume.

  .. warning::

    The set of provided processing or filtering nodes at this point is pretty limited, for example these don't 
    include nodes to "merge" multiple scenes together. Additionally, DFG support for the assembly graph is planned but
    hasn't been realized at this point.

SceneAssembly example: SceneGraph to RTR 
----------------------------------------

Below is illustrated a simple scene processing graph for providing culled geometries and lights to the :ref:`rtr2`:

.. image:: /images/SceneHub/SceneAssembly.png

In the diagram above:

- The "Query geometry" and "Query lights" nodes are :kl-ref:`SceneGraph` specific implementations of
  :kl-ref:`SWDynamicGroup` element queries (:kl-ref:`SGInstanceQuery`) which are embedding
  different specialized scene element filters (:kl-ref:`SGGeometryInstanceFilter` and :kl-ref:`SGBaseLightInstanceFilter`).

- The geometry group is then filtered based on a "visible" property using the :kl-ref:`VisiblePropertyGroupFilter`

- The light and geometry groups are filtered based on the :kl-ref:`RTRCamera` volume, which is a 
  :kl-ref:`DynamicGroupVolumeFilter` specialized for the :ref:`rtr2`. A SceneGraph to RTR adaptor
  allows to adapt SceneGraph's :kl-ref:`SGCamera` to the RTR-specialized :kl-ref:`RTRCamera`.

- Finally, RTR-specific adaptors are created for the resulting scene geometry instances and lights.
  These adaptors allow to map scene-specific types, such as :kl-ref:`SGDirectionalLight` and
  :kl-ref:`SGInstance`, to corresponding RTR objects, such as :kl-ref:`RTRDirectionalLight`
  and :kl-ref:`RTRSWInstance`. See :ref:`scenehub_adaptors` for more details about the adaptor mechanism.
