Important Notes - Read Me First!
--------------------------------

- Fabric Engine requires a video card and driver that support OpenGL 3.2 or later.

- Creation Platform has been rebranded as 'Fabric Engine' and the 'Fabric Engine Scene Graph'.  Because of this rebranding, it may be necessary to make slight changes to existing applications to make them work with 1.10.0.  See :ref:`upgrading-apps-1.10.0.scene-graph` for more information.

- Because of the branding changes in version 1.10.0, we recommend that you :ref:`uninstall previous versions <installing-1.10.0.uninstall-previous>` before installing version 1.10.0.

- To install 1.10.0 only for the current user, select the "Advanced" option after accepting the EULA in the Window installer.

Major Changes in 1.10.0
-------------------------------------------------------------

Fabric Splice
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The major news for this release is the inclusion of the Splice API for the first time. Splice allows you to take advantage of Fabric from within other applications, including Maya, Softimage, Nuke and Arnold. To learn more about Splice, check out the full demo here: http://fabricengine.com/splice/

- The Splice plugins are available for download here: http://dist.fabric-engine.com/FabricSplice/1.10.0/

- Once you have Splice installed you can follow our video tutorials: https://vimeo.com/channels/fabrictraining. This is a great way for you to learn KL and start seeing benefit from Fabric immediately."

Fabric Engine Scene Graph
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Due to branding changes there are slight changes to the namespaces and object names used by the Fabric Engine Scene Graph; see :ref:`upgrading-apps-1.10.0.scene-graph`.

Fabric Engine Extensions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- A new Geometry KL-only extension now regroups the PolygonMesh, Lines, HierarchicalGrid and other related types

- The PolygonMesh object has been rewritten, and its interface has largely changed. The improvements include the support for:

  - incremental structural changes (modeling operations), such as splitPolygon, splitPoint, deletePolygon, mergeMesh

    - demonstrated by new sample Apps/Geometry/LinearSubdivideAndEmbossMesh.py

  - 32-bits or 64-bits positions precision

  - setting attribute values (UVs, normals...) at any moment

  - raycast and getClosest queries:
  
    - returns a new Location type, allowing to read any PolygonMesh surface attribute (position, UVs...)
     
    - accelerated by a dynamic octree (same as RTR's full scene octree)

    - demonstrated by new sample Apps/Geometry/MeshRaycast.py

Fabric Engine Realtime Renderer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The RTR reference guide now includes a learning guide, in the form of tutorials with detailed explanations

- Support for a new DebugContext type for KL callbacks, allowing to dump the RTR pass function call stack and parameter stack anywhere in the passes

- Support for basic hardware instancing, using either texture-packed or attribute-packed instances shader parameters to encode instance-varying parameters

  - demonstrated by new sample Apps/Rendering/HardwareInstancing.py

SGCAPI Changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The SGCAPI was renamed from CPCAPI to be consistent with the rebranding of the SceneGraph from Creation Platform.

The following lists changes relevant to code using the SCAPI

 - The namespace used in the code was renamed from CreationPlatform to SGCAPI. 
 
 - The environment variable used to point to the install location of the SGCAPU was renamed from CPCAPI_DIR to SGCAPI_DIR
 
 - The CreationPlatformAPI_x86_64.props file was renamed to SceneGraphAPI_x86_64.props
 
 - The build lib is rename from CreationPlatformCAPI.lib to SceneGraphCAPI.lib

Core Changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Core memory and on-disk cache usage has dramatically improved
  
  - The core uses about one half of the memory it did in version 1.9.0
  
  - The core uses only about 10% of the on-disk cache that it used in version 1.9.0

- KL:
  
  - KL now supports constant expressions.  When several constants are 
    involved in a constant expression, the result is constant.  This allows
    you to declare code such as::
      
      const UInt32 FlagBitIndex = 7;
      const UInt32 FlagBitMask = 1 << FlagBitIndex;
    
    See :ref:`KLPG.global.named-constants` for more information.
  
  - The ``inline`` keyword has be introduced, allowing explicit control of
    function and method inlining.  See :ref:`inline`.
  
  - The ``use`` keyword has be deprecated; use ``require`` instead.  See
    :ref:`KLPG.require`

- The startup console output from the Core has been made less verbose and more
  readable.

.. _installing-1.10.0:

Installing Fabric Engine
---------------------------------------

Fabric Engine runs on Windows 7 SP1 (both 32- and 64-bit), CentOS 6.3, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion" or later.

.. _installing-1.10.0.uninstall-previous:

Uninstall Previous Versions of Fabric Engine/Creation Platform
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you have installed a previous version of Fabric Engine
(previously called Creation Platform) using an installer package, we recommend
that you uninstall it before installing Fabric Engine
1.10.0.  This is due to the branding changes the product has
undergone: they may cause issues in detecting upgrades on certain platforms.

- To uninstall previous versions on Windows, use the "Programs and Features" control panel.

- To uninstall previous versions on Mac OS X, simply remove (or rename) the ``/Library/FabricEngine`` directory.

- To uninstall previous versions on CentOS, run (as an administrator): ``sudo rpm -e creation-platform``

- To uninstall previous versions on Ubuntu, run (as an administrator): ``sudo dpkg -r creation-platform``

Install Python
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you don't already have Python on your system, you need to install it first.

- For Windows, you can get the latest version of Python 2.7 directly from http://python.org. You will also need to add the Python folders, usually C:\\Python27, and C:\\Python27\\Scripts, to your PATH environment variable.

  - On 64-bit Windows, we also provide a build of Fabric Engine that works with Python 2.6.

- For CentOS 6.3, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, your system already came with the right version of Python installed.

- For OS X, Python 2.7 is automatically installed on your system as part of the base OS install.

  .. note::
    
    On Mac OS X you must use the system-installed version of Python found in
    ``/usr/bin/python``. Using a different version of Python (installed via
    MacPorts or HomeBrew, for example) will result on a crash when trying to
    run any Fabric Engine application.

Once the install is finished, make sure that you are able to open a command
prompt and run python. Windows users will probably have to add the directory
in which Python was installed (usually ``c:\\Python27``) to their PATH environment
variable.

.. note::
  
  On previous Windows versions of Fabric Engine, it was possible
  to disable the installation of PySide in the Fabric Engine
  installer in order to use another version.  It is not longer possible
  to do this: instead, if you need to use another version of PySide simply
  follow the steps for :ref:`installing from an archive <installing-1.10.0.archive>` and then simply remove (or rename) the ``FabricEngine/Python/<PYTHON_VERSION>/PySide`` directory.

There are two ways of installing Fabric Engine: :ref:`from an installer package <installing-1.10.0.package>` or :ref:`from an archive <installing-1.10.0.archive>`.

.. _installing-1.10.0.package:

Installing from an Installer Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing from an installer package is generally easier but is less flexible.
We recommend this approach if you are evaluating Fabric Engine for a
single user, you are fine with using the version of PySide that is bundled
with Fabric Engine, and you only need to have a single version of
Fabric Engine installed.

From http://dist.fabric-engine.com/FabricEngine/1.10.0/, download and install Fabric Engine for your platform.

.. note::
  
  When selecting the 32-bit vs. 64-bit version to install on Windows, note that it is the "bitness" of Python, and not Windows, that matters.  To see if the version of Python you are using is 64-bit, simply run "python" from a command prompt.  If it has ``64 bit (AMD64)`` somewhere in the first line it displays then it is 64-bit.

- On Windows 7 using 32-bit Python, the installer is ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer-Windows-32Bit-Python2.7.msi``. It is a .MSI file that can be run directly. Note that the installer is unsigned, so your browser may tell you it's not safe to run it.

- On Windows 7 using 64-bit Python, the installer is ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer-Windows-64Bit-Python2.7.msi`` (for Python 2.7) or ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer-Windows-64Bit-Python2.6.msi`` (for Python 2.6). It is a .MSI file that can be run directly. Note that the installer is unsigned, so your browser may tell you it's not safe to run it.

- On CentOS 6.3, the installer is ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer-CentOS-x86_64-Python2.6.rpm``. It is a .rpm package that can be installed using 'rpm -i' or using a GUI tool.

  .. note:: you must log out and log back in in order to get the environment variables set that Fabric Engine needs to run!

- On Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, the installer is ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer-Ubuntu-amd64-Python2.6.deb``. It is a .deb package that can be installed using 'dpkg -i' or using a GUI tool.

  .. note:: you must log out and log back in in order to get the environment variables set that Fabric Engine needs to run!

- On Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, the installer is ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer-Ubuntu-amd64-Python2.7.deb``. It is a .deb package that can be installed using 'dpkg -i' or using a GUI tool.

  .. note:: you must log out and log back in in order to get the environment variables set that Fabric Engine needs to run!

- On Mac OS X Lion or Mountain Lion, the installer is ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer-MacOSX-64Bit-Python2.7.dmg``. It is an executable on a .dmg file that can be run directly from the mounted disk image.

  .. note:: you must restart your system in order to get the environment variables set that Fabric Engine needs to run!

.. _installing-1.10.0.archive:

Installing from an Archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing from an archive provides the most flexibility.  You can control the
location of the install, use a custom version of PySide, and even install and
use multiple versions of Fabric Engine on the same machine.

From http://dist.fabric-engine.com/FabricEngine/1.10.0/, download and install a Fabric Engine installer archive.
  
  - The filename begins with ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Installer``
  
  - For Windows, the archive filename ends with ``.zip``.
  
  - For Linux and Mac OS X, the archive filename ends with ``.tar.bz2``.

Be sure to pick the archive that matches the characteristics of your system
(eg. Python 2.7 vs. Python 2.6, 32-bit vs. 64-bit).

Unpack the archive in a location of your choosing, then edit the file ``environment.bat`` (Windows) or ``environment.sh`` (Mac OS X and Linux), changing ``BASEDIR`` to the directory into which you unpacked the archive.

Whenever you want to use Fabric Engine, open up a console/terminal window and then execute the environment script:

  - Under Windows, run ``PATH_TO_UNPACKED_ARCHIVE\environment.bat``
  
  - Under Mac OS X and Linux, run ``source PATH_TO_UNPACKED_ARCHIVE/environment.sh``

Test Fabric Engine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Fabric Engine installer ships with a simple application, HelloSceneGraph, that can be used to test the installation. To run HelloSceneGraph:

-  On Windows:

  - Open a command prompt (cmd.exe)

  - Change to the Fabric Engine install directory (usually ``C:\\Program Files\\Fabric Engine`` for per-machine installs and ``C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\Apps\\Fabric Engine`` for per-user installs)

  - Run ``python Python\HelloFabric.py``

- On Ubuntu, open a shell and run ``python /usr/lib/FabricEngine/Python/HelloFabric.py``

- On CentOS, open a shell and run ``python /usr/lib64/FabricEngine/Python/HelloFabric.py``

- On Mac OS X, open Terminal and run ``python /Library/FabricEngine/FABRIC_VERSION/Python/HelloFabric.py``

Install Sample Applications ("Demos")
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From http://dist.fabric-engine.com/FabricEngine/1.10.0/, download the ``FabricEngine-1.10.0-Demos.zip`` file, which you can extract to a location of your choosing. The demos are located below the Apps subfolder of the created ``FabricEngine-Demos-1.10.0`` folder, and are identical for all platforms. These demos can be run using the python command; for example, ``python Apps/GeometryDeformation.py``.

.. _documentation-1.10.0:

Documentation
-------------

Complete documentation for Fabric Engine can be :ref:`found here <TOP>`.

After installing Fabric Engine, you can also find the documentation in the Start menu in Windows, the Applications menu in CentOS and Ubuntu, and through a link in the '/Applications/FabricEngine/1.10.0' folder in Mac OS X. The documentation can also be accessed from the "Help" menu of Fabric Engine applications.

.. _upgrading-apps-1.10.0:

Upgrading Applications to Version 1.10.0
----------------------------------------------------

.. _upgrading-apps-1.10.0.scene-graph:

Fabric Engine Scene Graph
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In version 1.10.0, Creation Platform was rebranded as 'Fabric Engine' (for the name of the whole product) and 'Fabric Engine Scene Graph' (for the name of the Python scene graph).  Because of this rebranding, it may be necessary to make slight changes to existing Python scene graph applications to make them work with 1.10.0.

- The namespace used by the SceneGraph was renamed from ``FabricEngine.CreationPlatform`` to ``FabricEngine.SceneGraph``

- ``BaseCreationPlatformApplication`` was renamed to ``BaseSceneGraphApplication``

- ``CreationPlatformApplication`` was renamed to ``SceneGraphApplication``

- The fileLocation manager was updated to use new tokens for resolving files.
  
  - The token ``$CP`` was renamed to ``$SG``
  
  - The token ``$CPAPP`` was renamed to ``$SGAPP``
  
  - The token ``$CPSCENE`` was renamed to ``$SGSCENE``
  
  .. warning: These change may cause Apps to not be able to find thier render passes files until they are fixed 

Updating Scene Graph apps from version 1.9 to 1.10 is mostly a process of replacing the old names with the new ones.

.. _compiling-1.10.0:

- PolygonMesh functions were largely modified, please refer to files such as ``PolygonMeshTorus.kl`` or ``OBJImporter.kl`` for examples of usage.

- RTR shader parameter XML attribute ``transformReferential`` was renamed to ``transformSpace``

Optional: Compiling the DCC Integrations
----------------------------------------

In order to use the DCC integrations after you have installed Fabric Engine you will need to download the SGCAPI (Scene Graph C++ API) source files here: `SGCAPI for Fabric Engine 1.10.0 <http://dist.fabric-engine.com/FabricEngine/1.10.0/FabricEngine-SGCAPI-1.10.0.zip>`_

You will then need to consult the .. kl-extlist::
DCCIG, in particular the section on "Installing and using the SGCAPI". In there you will find instructions on how to compile and any necessary environment variables that must be set.

The currently supported DCC integrations are:

- Maya 2013 on Windows 64-bit

- Maya 2013 on Linux 64-bit

- SoftImage 2013 on Windows 64-bit

That's it!
