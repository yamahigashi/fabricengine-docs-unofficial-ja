Comprehensive Changes
---------------------------------

- SpliceMaya: Maya 2016 is now supported. For best results, use the legacy viewport, not Viewport2.0.

- SpliceMaya: Added menu option for 'Create SpliceMayaDeformer as Referenced' (FE-4389)

- SpliceMaya: You can now tear off viewports (FE-4207)

- SpliceMaya: getPortInfo() now returns the correct value (FE-4115)

- SpliceSoftimage: Passing array of Matrices of size >8 no longer crashes Softimage (FE-4475)

- Splice: DrawContext now has additional methods to retrieve per viewport param dictionaries. These can be filled in splice nodes or in python through RTVals. The viewport now has a getName and setName method, which are used in the Maya render callback. See InlineDrawing_context.ma for an example. (FE-4240)

- DCC Conversion: The following helper functions have been added: Image2DDCConversion.kl, LinesDCCConversion.kl, PointsDCCConversion.kl, PolygonMeshDCCConversion.kl (FE-4262)

- Docstrings: Docstrings for added methods are now added in the defining extension as well as on the target type. (FE-4549)

- OpenImageIO: missing symbols have been added (FE-4459)

- Alembic Reader: Now supports curves (FE-4508)

- Alembic Reader: Get methods for private members have been added (FE-4163)

- Alembic Sample: Problems with the InlineDrawing sample were fixed by addressing an issue with the AlembicWarpper extension (FE-4455)

- Bug Fix: Orthographic views now work for manipulation (FE-4260)

- Bug Fix: FABRIC_NODES_PATH now works properly (FE-4420)

- Bug Fix: FEC_EnableDebug logic was wrong and caused unwanted stack trace dumps in the Math extension. This has been fixed.  (FE-4225)

- Limitation: Drawing Weight Maps at the same time as underlying objects is problematic due to lack of full handling of transparency in InlineDrawing (FE-4626)

- Limitation: Warnings about shearing errors from the Math extension can slow down performance in Maya if the script editor is open. Workaround: Close the script editor during playback.
