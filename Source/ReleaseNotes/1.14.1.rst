Changes in Fabric Engine 1.14.1
-------------------------------------

Core
++++++

- Fixed a bug in the KL compiler that occasionally resulted in the message "Error: unrecognized heapSpec value", usually followed by a crash.

- Fixed a big in the KL compiler that would result in a "null" owned interface being casted to a non-"null" unowned ("Ref<>") interface.  Using this unowned interface would usually result in a crash.

- Fixed a bug in RTVals that would incorrectly calculate the offset of members into RTVals when the RTVals are objects that involve multiple levels of inheritance.

- Fixed a crash in kl2edk when processing methods whose names are less than six characters long.

- Expose fewer global symbols from Extension DLL/.so files, which will help avoid conflicting dynamic library symbols in host applications.

- Clean up error message when loading an extension with a missing KL source file.

- Fix check for Windows version when running on latest versions of Windows.

- Remove support for Python 2.6 on OS X because no one is using it and it can no longer be targetted when building on OS X 10.10 ("Yosemite").

SpliceAPI
+++++++++++++

- Fix conversion from internal port to non-internal port when de-serializing.

- Fixed UNGUARDED env var behaviour.

- KL operators with errors were not being persisted; this has been fixed.

- Ensure that Splice passes KL error and warning details from Core to user.

- Allow building with boost 1.42.

- Fix crash on client creation when no extension folders are specified.

- Various fixes related to evaluation context.

- We now set the 'time' value in the drawcontext in all DCC Splice integrations.

- Fixed parsing of integer and boolean options.

SpliceMaya
++++++++++++++++

- A major performance issue related to propagating dirty state to and from Maya has been addressed.  This fix provides a significant performance increase in many Splice Maya scenes, particuarly those with Splice nodes with many ports.

- Fix a bug in the handling of compound attributes that could result in a crash in unguarded mode.

- Maya deformer was not operating on meshes array; fixed.

- Export only Maya load/unload calls from shared library to avoid issues with conflicting library symbols.

SpliceSoftimage
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Integrated new viewport changes.

- We now support traversing the Resources/Splice folder.

- Integrated the Fabric Python module into Softimage.

- Log messages are now sent to Softimage at "Verbose" level so they can be disabled for performance reasons.

Geometry Extension
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- Add support for "merge points" operation on PolygonMesh.

- Various fixes for generation of geometry primitives.

InlineDrawing Extension
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed an invalid reference issue that could cause crashes when rendering after remove instances.  This could sometimes manifest as crashes when closing scenes.

- Fixed InlineCamera.setFromPositionAndTarget method.

- Added better error messages.

Characters Extension
++++++++++++++++++++

- Fix error when bones have length 0.

OpenImageIO Extension
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed export of library symbols so that libpng library symbols do not conflict with host application.
