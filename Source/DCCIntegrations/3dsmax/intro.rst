Introduction
============

  Fabric for 3ds Max is the integration of Fabric Canvas in 3ds Max.

  The plugin allows you to use Fabric inside your 3ds Max projects for procedural geometry creation, deformation and controlling the transformation of objects (e.g. for rigging). 
  
  Fabric for 3ds Max also exposes the manipulation system and Fabric's native graphical user interface (the display driver should be set to OpenGL).
