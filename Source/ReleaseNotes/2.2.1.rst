Known Issues, Limitations and Workarounds
-----------------------------------------

- **Limitation**: Maya 2016 Ext 2 on OS X now requires using the "OpenGL Strict" profile. This is a change from previous versions of Maya 2016 and will cause the following error message to be displayed in the viewport: "Current drawing engine does not support legacy viewport."

    Workaround: Set “OpenGL Legacy” mode in the Maya Windows Settings/Preferences dialogue. You will find it at the bottom of the Viewport 2.0 section.

- **Limitation**: Using undo/redo shortcuts after creating a canvas node gives errors in Maya 2015

    Workaround: Disable the Toggle Renderer Check.
