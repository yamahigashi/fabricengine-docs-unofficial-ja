Introduction
==============

|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| is a high-performance processing engine that integrates with dynamic languages by exposing an interface for defining multi-threaded native code operations. |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| enables high-performance applications to be built using dynamic languages by providing an environment where processor-intensive tasks can be offloaded and processed using multi-threaded native code.

Ease Of Use
---------------

|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| has been designed for developers who are comfortable building tools and services using dynamic languages. Developers working with |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| do not require experience of performance software development, nor do they need knowledge of complex languages such as C++. 

Developers continue to work with the same tools they are already familiar with, and they can run their applications or services in the usual way. Existing applications and services can be modified to incorporate |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| for handling compute intensive tasks. Since the majority of code in most applications is not performance critical, this code can continue to be written in the developers' preferred language. No custom IDE or compilation tool chain is required as |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| integrates a compiler and loads source code from text files.

Dynamic Environment
----------------------

|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| is a completely dynamic development environment where all data structures, graph structures, and code are specified at run time. |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| can be integrated with any programming language, and is currently integrated with JavaScript and Python. We will add support for other languages over time.

This development paradigm significantly lowers the technical level required to write multi-threaded code, and enables a broad range of developers to build high-performance applications.
