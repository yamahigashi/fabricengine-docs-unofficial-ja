|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| is an accessible and portable development framework that helps visual effects and games studios reduce the cost and risk of building high-performance custom tools. |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| allows users to easily create standalone applications or extend their content creation applications without needing a deep understanding multi-threading or GPU coding, or technical languages like C++.

Included with Fabric 2 is a standalone utility called :dfn:`Fabric Standalone` as well as a series of integrations into existing DCC (Digital Content Creation) applications, such as Autodesk Maya, The Foundry MODO or Autodesk Softimage. 

You can use the :dfn:`Fabric Standalone` to get familiar with the |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| visual programming paradigm, and also to write your very first KL node directly within the application (see :ref:`CANVASUSERGUIDE` for more information).

If you are interested in one of the integrations for Fabric :dfn:`Canvas` you will find the relevant information here as well. Using :dfn:`Canvas` within DCCs provides a high performance alternative to the host application's features while being 100% portable! If you are interested in using :dfn:`Canvas` directly within a DCC, you can skip to the :ref:`GETTINGSTARTED_DCCINSTALLATION` section. If you want to know more information about the Canvas user interface, please refer to the :ref:`CANVASUSERGUIDE`.
