<p>CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Notice</div></blockquote>
<p>This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
the two main principles guiding its drafting:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
users,</li>
<li>secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The authors of the CeCILL-C (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre])
license are:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>Preamble</div></blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
the right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.</p>
<p>The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make
available to the community the modifications made to the source code of
the software so as to contribute to its evolution.</p>
<p>In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
with a limited warranty and the software&#8217;s author, the holder of the
economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.</p>
<p>In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
the user&#8217;s attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
removed herefrom.</p>
<p>This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.</p>

to carry out hereunder.</p>
<p>5.2 RIGHT OF MODIFICATION</p>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<div>5.3 RIGHT OF DISTRIBUTION</div></blockquote>
<p>In particular, the right of distribution includes the right to publish,
transmit and communicate the Software to the general public on any or
all medium, and by any or all means, and the right to market, either in
consideration of a fee, or free of charge, one or more copies of the
Software by any means.</p>
<p>The Licensee is further authorized to distribute copies of the modified
or unmodified Software to third parties according to the terms and
conditions set forth hereinafter.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>5.3.1 DISTRIBUTION OF SOFTWARE WITHOUT MODIFICATION</div></blockquote>
<p>The Licensee is authorized to distribute true copies of the Software in
Source Code or Object Code form, provided that said distribution
complies with all the provisions of the Agreement and is accompanied by:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>a copy of the Agreement,</li>
<li>a notice relating to the limitation of both the Licensor&#8217;s
warranty and liability as set forth in Articles 8 and 9,</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>and that, in the event that only the Object Code of the Software is
redistributed, the Licensee allows effective access to the full Source
Code of the Software at a minimum during the entire period of its
distribution of the Software, it being understood that the additional
cost of acquiring the Source Code shall not exceed the cost of
transferring the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>5.3.2 DISTRIBUTION OF MODIFIED SOFTWARE</div></blockquote>
<p>When the Licensee makes an Integrated Contribution to the Software, the
terms and conditions for the distribution of the resulting Modified

period of its distribution of the Modified Software, it being understood
that the additional cost of acquiring the source code shall not exceed
the cost of transferring the data.</p>
<blockquote>

may be distributed under a license agreement other than this Agreement,
subject to compliance with the requirement to include a notice
concerning the rights over the Software as defined in Article 6.4.
In the event the creation of the Derivative Software required modification
of the Source Code, the Licensee undertakes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">the resulting Modified Software will be governed by this Agreement,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">the Integrated Contributions in the resulting Modified Software
will be clearly identified and documented,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">the Licensee will allow effective access to the source code of the
Modified Software, at a minimum during the entire period of
distribution of the Derivative Software, such that such
modifications may be carried over in a subsequent version of the

Related Module subject to the CeCILL license agreement, the provisions
set forth in the third item of Article 6.4 are optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Article 6 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</p>
<blockquote>
<div>6.1 OVER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software. Any or
all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms
and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work
and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the
distribution of said Initial Software.</p>
<p>The Holder undertakes that the Initial Software will remain ruled at
least by this Agreement, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>6.2 OVER THE INTEGRATED CONTRIBUTIONS</div></blockquote>
<p>The Licensee who develops an Integrated Contribution is the owner of the
intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by
applicable law.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>6.3 OVER THE RELATED MODULES</div></blockquote>
<p>The Licensee who develops a Related Module is the owner of the
intellectual property rights over this Related Module as defined by
applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall
govern its distribution under the conditions defined in Article 5.3.3.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>6.4 NOTICE OF RIGHTS</div></blockquote>
<p>The Licensee expressly undertakes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property
notices attached to the Software;</li>
<li>to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies
of the Software modified or not;</li>
<li>to ensure that use of the Software, its intellectual property
notices and the fact that it is governed by the Agreement is
indicated in a text that is easily accessible, specifically from
the interface of any Derivative Software.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the
intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors on the
Software and to take, where applicable, vis-à-vis its staff, any and all
measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual property rights
of the Holder and/or Contributors.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES</div></blockquote>
<p>7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.</p>
<p>However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
shall incur liability therefor.</p>
<p>7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
and the Licensee.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 8 - LIABILITY</div></blockquote>
<p>8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be
entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.</p>
<p>8.2 The Licensor&#8217;s liability is limited to the commitments made under
this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
(i) loss due the Licensee&#8217;s total or partial failure to fulfill its
obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
any or all compensation from the Licensor.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 9 - WARRANTY</div></blockquote>
<p>9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee&#8217;s
attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
reserved for experienced users.</p>
<p>The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
or properties.</p>
<p>9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
rights set forth in Article 5).</p>
<p>9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &#8220;as is&#8221; by
