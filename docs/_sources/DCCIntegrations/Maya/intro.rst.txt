Introduction
============

Fabric for Maya was built with usability in mind, so rather than providing only the set of APIs for programmers to integrate it in existing DCCs a Maya plugin has also been created for TDs, with a command for scripting as well as a native graphical user interface and OpenGL visual-debugging in the 3D Viewport. The plug-in offers a very tight integration of Canvas inside Maya, allowing TDs to instantiate a custom Maya node or a deformer to subsequently author the contained Canvas graphs, the nodes will operate as standard maya computational units, while Canvas graphs will allow TDs to safely build performance critical code for any kind of purpose, such as rigging, FX simulation or any other kind of heavy data processing.
