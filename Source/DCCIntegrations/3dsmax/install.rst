Installation
============

Fabric for 3ds Max is distributed as a .dlu plugin and is located in the folder ``<FABRIC-LOCATION>/DCC_Integrations``. 

Fabric for 3ds Max expects certain environment variables to be set. To simplify the process, a batch file is included in each Fabric3dsmax* folder. Running the batch file should set-up the plugin and launch 3ds Max.

.. note::
  The first time the plugin is launched, all the provided extensions will be built for the target platform. This may take a few minutes.
  
After 3ds Max is launch, you can test the plugin works fine by loading a sample scene found in ``<FABRIC-LOCATION>/Samples/Fabric3dsMax``.
