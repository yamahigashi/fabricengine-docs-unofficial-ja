KL2DFG Command line utility
===============================

kl2dfg is a command line executable which allows to generate Canvas preset files for a given KL extension. If successful, it creates a log file called :dfn:`kl2dfg.log` in the destination folder which lists the complete process. To use the resulting presets in Canvas the target folder has to be on the :envvar:`FABRIC_DFG_PATH` environment variable. Alternatively you can also specify a subfolder for an extension to provide Canvas presets using the :code:`dfgPresets` member. Please see :ref:`EAG.fpm` for more information.

To try out KL2DFG, simply open a shell using the Fabric environment variables (see :ref:`GETTINGSTARTED_BASEINSTALLATION`), and type 

.. cmdline:: kl2dfg

kl2dfg supports a series of options, which can be obtained by running kl2dfg with the :dfn:`help` flag

.. cmdline:: kl2dfg --help

Available options:

list
-------
Presents the user with a list of doxygen modifiers which can be used to drive kl2dfg's behavior. Doxygen qualifiers can be used inside the doxygen style comments of a function. For example:

.. code-block:: kl

    /// \dfgPresetTitle MyPresetName
    function Boolean someFunction(Scalar a)

Will cause kl2dfg to pick a different name for the preset than the name of the function. For a full list of qualifiers please use the :dfn:`list` flag.

.. cmdline:: kl2dfg -list

polyThis
-----------------------

kl2dfg will generate only one preset for methods with the same notation within an extension, with respect to a common "this" type (or return type, in the case of functions). For example:

.. code-block:: kl

    function SInt32 Vec3.getMySum() { ... }
    
    function SInt32 Vec4.getMySum() { ... }

Would result in only one Canvas preset file, called :dfn:`Func.getMySum` instead of two separate presets for :dfn:`Vec3` and :dfn:`Vec4`.

.. note:: You can find more information about the consequences of polymorphism here: :ref:`canvas-programmer-guide-polymorphism`.

polyParams
-----------------------

kl2dfg will generate only one preset for methods with the same notation within an extension, with respect to parameter types. For example:

.. code-block:: kl

    function SInt32 MyType.someFunc(Integer x) { ... }
    
    function SInt32 MyType.someFunc(Float32 x) { ... }

Would result in one Canvas preset file, called :dfn:`MyType.someFunc`, that has a polymorphic type for the first parameter.

.. note:: You can find more information about the consequences of polymorphism here: :ref:`canvas-programmer-guide-polymorphism`.

inheritance
-------------------

Enables the generation of presets for inherited methods. For example:

.. code-block:: kl

  interface i {
    String getName();
  };

  object a : i {
    SInt32 index;
  };

  function a.getName() {
    return 'a'+this.index;
  }

  object b : a {
  };

  function b.reportSomething() {
    report('something');
  }

Without inheritance the presets generated would be:

.. code-block:: bash

    a.getName
    b.reportSomething

With inheritance enabled the presets generated would be:

.. code-block:: bash

    a.getName
    b.getName
    b.reportSomething

can also enable this functionality on a per preset basis by using the :dfn:`dfgUseInheritance` doxygen qualifier.

genAllArrays
-------------------
Enables the generation of array presets for given methods. This makes working with arrays inside of Canvas much easier. You can also enable this functionality on a per preset basis by using the :dfn:`dfgCreateArrayPreset` doxygen qualifier.

.. note:: This functionality might be deprecated in future version of kl2dfg.

addExecutePort
--------------------

.. note::
  
  This option is deprecated, since as of version 2.2.0 all instance nodes in Canvas automatically have a first Execute port called 'exec'.

For easier daisy chaining of Canvas presets kl2dfg supports to add an extra port as the first port of any Canvas preset.
You can also enable this functionality on a per preset basis by using the :dfn:`dfgAddExecutePort` doxygen qualifier.

polyThisInTypeDir
---------------------

By default, presets that are polymorphic in 'this' will only be placed in the
generic 'Func' subdirectory of the target directory.  Using this flag will
also place them in the type directory for each type for which 'this' applies.

noPolyThisInFuncDir
---------------------

By default, presets that are polymorphic in 'this' will be placed in the
generic 'Func' subdirectory of the target directory.  Using this flag will
disable this behaviour.

Example
------------------
Generating all math presets in a temporary location:

.. cmdline:: kl2dfg $FABRIC_DIR/Exts/Builtin/Math/Math.fpm.json $TEMP
