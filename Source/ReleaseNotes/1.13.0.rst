Important Notes - Read Me First!
--------------------------------

- We have removed PySide from the Fabric Engine distribution.

  - If you are on OS X you should remove the symlink located at :file:`/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/PySide`, otherwise if you later install PySide from a third-party package manager such as Homebrew it may not be found.

- OSX Splice Standalone support requires the latest Qt (4.8.6) which can be downloaded here: http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
 
- Fabric Engine requires a video card and driver that support OpenGL 3.2 or later.

.. _downloads-1.13.0:

Downloads
---------

All downloads for Fabric Engine 1.13.0 can be obtained at http://dist.fabric-engine.com/FabricEngine/1.13.0/.  For information on installation please refer to the :ref:`InstallationGuide`.

Major Changes in Fabric Engine 1.13.0
-------------------------------------

Installers
++++++++++

- Fabric Engine is no longer distributed with installer packages (eg. .msi, .rpm); only installer archives (.zip) are provided. More information on installation can be found in the :ref:`InstallationGuide`.

Scene Graph
+++++++++++

- The old Python Scene Graph has been removed.

- We are working on a SceneGraph 2.0 for the release of Fabric Engine 2.0.

Licensing
+++++++++

- Licensing is no longer required for individual use.  If no license information is found, Fabric starts with the message “Licensed for individual use only” and there is no longer a pause when starting up.

Documentation
+++++++++++++

- The documentation has been significantly overhauled and expanded. Almost all extensions have much more complete documentation; in particular, the Geometry extension is now much better documented. Additionally all types can be clicked upon, inheritance diagrams have been added and much more. See :kl-ref:`InlineEntityBase` for an example.

KLExtensionsGuide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Most extension documentation now also includes example code for how to use the extension.

- A new :ref:`KLSTYLEGUIDE` has been written to provide some guidance on how to format KL code and include documentation within KL code.

Splice
++++++

- A new C++ :ref:`SPLICESTANDALONE` application shell has been provided to make it easier to write standalone C++ Splice applications.

- New :kl-ref:`EvalContext` KL object. This provides access to host and graph information, as well as dirty flag filtering.

- Maya now supports use of the :kl-ref:`Detachable` interface, which is invoked when a node in maya is deleted or undo is performed.

- :kl-ref:`Manipulator` objects can now call custom commands in the :kl-ref:`Host` application, using the :kl-ref:`Host.callCustomCommand` method. This allows to perform script command actions when manipulation occurs, for example to set an attribute value within the DCC.

- The Maya Deformer now uses an array of :kl-ref:`PolygonMesh` objects instead of mesh0, mesh1 etc ports. 

- Customizable persistence support by using the :kl-ref:`Persistable` interface.

- SpliceNodes in Maya now persist both opaqueness and internal states of ports.

- Compound attribute structure is now persisted in Maya.

- Maya is now supported on OS X.

- Splice is now linked against boost 1.55.

- Construction of the Fabric Core client now happens in the FabricSpliceBaseInterface::constructBaseInterface in Maya Splice. (Custom Splice Nodes will have to be adapted for this). This fixes startup times on Maya 2012 or earlier.

Extensions
++++++++++

- Extensions now support versioning, allowing users to load specific versions of extensions in their KL code. For more information see :ref:`EXTS_VERSIONING`.

- New binary stream support in the :ref:`fileio_extension` to support Splice persistence changes.

- New :ref:`json_extension` to support parsing and writing of json data strings.

- New :ref:`spliceinterfaces_extension`.

- The :ref:`alembic_extension` is now available as a public repository. See http://github.com/fabric-engine/Alembic for the source code.

Geometry Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Geometry extension refactored to use KL inheritance.

- Containers/allocator objects moved to a new Containers extension

- New SkinningAttribute for variable count of id-weight pairs per point.

- SpatialQuery: new line and semi-line intersection methods.

Manipulation Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Refactored to use KL inheritance which simplified the development of custom manipulators.

- The 'MultiChannelPaintManipulator' was moved to the 'RiggingToolbox' found here https://github.com/fabric-engine/RiggingToolbox

InlineDrawing Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The :ref:`inlinedrawing_extension` is now using inheritance. Some interfaces have been converted to objects. Your custom OGL Shaders will need refactoring.

- The new :kl-ref:`DrawingHandle` object for the inline drawing can help manage lifetimes of drawn elements.

- More tools to simplify the generation of visual debugging

- Inline Drawing now works on OS X

Characters Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The :ref:`characters_extension` is now using inheritance which simplifies working with the Characters API.


.. _RELNOTES-1.13.0-Core:

Fabric Core
+++++++++++

- Better stack traces when a KL exception occurs on Windows and Linux. Also, KL code can dump the current stack frame information as a debugging aid with the dumpstack() call.

- Debug info has been permanently enabled in KL applications, allowing easier debuggability.

- Performance improvements in loading applications, especially when cached.

- Extensions can now be reloaded while Fabric is running.

- Fabric Engine can now be run with no HOME directory set.

- Improvements to background optimization process allowing it to complete more quickly. 

KL Language and Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Support for inheritance in objects and structs (see :ref:`KPLG.structure.inheritance`, :ref:`KPLG.object.inheritance` and :ref:`KLPG.interfaces.inheritance`).

- Improved error and warning messages, especially in the case of polymorphic method resolution.

- A variable-length array can now be given an initial size when constructed.

- Structures can now be used as dictionary keys if the user provides an implementation for a .hash() method for the structure.

- A core client can now request a copy of the parsed KL syntax tree for Doxygen-like documentation purposes.

GPU Compute
^^^^^^^^^^^

- More detailed control over memory (CPU/GPU) via KL methods.

- Added :ref:`cudagl_extension` for binding GL buffer data into CUDA KL operators.

- Added :ref:`cudaglhelpers_extension` to provide a higher level buffer manager.

- See the updated :ref:`GPUCompute` for more information on changes to GPU compute.

.. _knownissues-1.13.0:

Known Issues
++++++++++++

- The Splice manipulation tool hotkey does not work in Maya 2015. You can use the Fabric Splice top menu to enable it.

.. _documentation-1.13.0:

Documentation
-------------

Complete documentation for Fabric Engine can be :ref:`found here <TOP>`.

.. _upgrading-apps-1.13.0:

Upgrading Applications to Version 1.13.0
----------------------------------------------------

- Previously implemented shaders for the :ref:`inlinedrawing_extension` will have to be upgraded to use KL inheritance. Please see the :kl-ref:`OGLSurfaceShader` for an example.

- Splice deformers for Maya should be rewritten to make use of the new :kl-ref:`PolygonMesh` array support. The old mesh0, mesh1, etc port list is still supported, but might be dropped in a future version.
