* **Fabric for MODO**

  Fabric for MODO is the integration of Fabric Canvas in The Foundry MODO (r).

  The plugin allows you to use Fabric inside your MODO projects for tasks such as creating complex procedural geometry, loading assets (e.g. Alembic, FBX) and controlling the transformation of objects (e.g. for rigging).

  The heart of Fabric for MODO are the two items called CanvasPI, the procedural mesh item, and CanvasIM, the channel modifier item.

  Furthermore, an extensive set of custom commands is provided to create Fabric items and entire graphs via scripting.
