Deprecation Warning
-------------------

The Dependency Graph is scheduled for deprecation for the 2.0 release of Fabric Engine. It will be replaced by the more powerful and flexible 'Data Flow Graph' architecture previewed at Siggraph 2014. We recommend using the Splice API for C++ tools, or building minimal Dependency Graphs that can be replaced by Data Flow Graphs in 2.0. The KL Language and extension system will remain consistent for 2.0 and so any investment in these areas will not be lost.
