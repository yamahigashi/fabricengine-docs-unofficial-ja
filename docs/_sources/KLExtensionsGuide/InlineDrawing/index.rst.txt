The :ref:`inlinedrawing_extension` provides a simple realtime rendering framework for direct rendering within DCCs such as Autodesk Maya, for example. The :ref:`inlinedrawing_extension` can also be used to render within the Fabric Engine standalone.

With the :ref:`inlinedrawing_extension` you can create renderable content in Fabric Engine, and a centralized render callback will then perform the rendering of the :kl-ref:`InlineDrawing`'s content. Please have a look at the :kl-ref:`OGLInlineDrawing` for a code example.

For further information please refer to the InlineDrawing Guide.
