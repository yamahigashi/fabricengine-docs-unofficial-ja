.. _knownissues-2.0.0-beta:

Known Issues, Limitations and Workarounds
-----------------------------------------

- Tip: In Canvas all inputs are also outputs as this helps control sequencing of operations.  For instance, you can more easily insert a “report” node between two nodes to see what the value is.

- Known Issue: Undo/Redo is unreliable. Watch for a daily build in the next week to ten days that will address this

- Known Issue: If Softimage is set to automatically load SpliceSoftimage and PyQtForSoftimage, it will crash.

- Workaround: Set Softimage to only load one of the two plugins at launch, and manually load the other.

- Known Issue: NodeToolBar not visible in Canvas (SpliceSoftimage)

- Workaround: Right-click on a node and choose 'Edit' to enter the node and edit its contents.

- Known Issue: Softimage will crash when closed after loading SpliceSoftimage. Please note that this does not lead to loss of data, it's just annoying. 

- Known Issue: Softimage will crash when using Fabric for Softimage on an installation with an old SolidAngle Arnold addon installed (SIToA). Please remove the addon temporarily when testing Fabric for Softimage.

- Limitation: debugPort related calls exist but are stubs. This functionality will not be added prior to official release but will be added in a following release.
