"The node :dfn:`FabricConstraint` is a standard pose constraint, "
"implemented as a Maya C++ node. It was implemented primarily to increase "
"the performance of Kraken rigs, but it can be used in any Maya DG. The "
"node's output transformation is split into a :dfn:`Translate`, a "
":dfn:`Rotate` and a :dfn:`Scale` port, so it can also be used as a "
"translation constraint, a rotation constraint, a scale constraint or any "
"combination of the three."
