"Fabric for MODO comes with a scripting interface which allows you to "
"author graphs from, for example, Python scripts. Script commands are "
"logged automatically when working with the UI, so most of the time you "
"won't need the reference below. You can just perform the work "
"interactively and investigate the logged script steps in MODO's \"Command"
" History\"."

"Commands in MODO either perform a task *or* return a value. This means "
"that you cannot execute a command and get its return value at the same "
